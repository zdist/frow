<i>We were Team NAZ:</i>

### What did we do? 
We created Frow's webpresence in a company organized Hackathon.

## Installation
You can simply visit Frow's website [here](https://zdist.github.io/frow/index/index.html) or you can go through the following steps to install Frow on your local machine:
1. Ensure you have Java installed on your system.
2. Clone or download this repository:
   
    ```https://github.com/zdisanto/frow.git```

4. Navigate to the directory where you cloned/downloaded the repository.
5. Open ```src/main/com/frow```
6. Run ```Frow.java```

## The Case
FROW, a fashion company founded in 2017, has more than 100 designers and 200 
vendors. 
- A lean canvas business model
- A product launch plan including a technical architecture
- Working MVP
- Product branding including logo
  
<i>More Tasks:</i>  
- Develop an e-commerce application accessible to vendors and designers across various devices.
- Implement features to display upcoming and ongoing events.
- Generate a Finance Projection chart to demonstrate Frow's growth by 30% within 2 years.
- Enable vendors to access specific designers and seasonal lines, with the option to purchase entire lines within the app.
- Provide users with the capability to publish designer fashion lines, browse, and make purchases.
   - Optionally, include a feature to view Fashion Shows live.
- Compile technical and functional materials to effectively address Board of Directors' concerns and support recommendations.
  
## The Goal
The company with the best solution will be selected and contracted to provide FROWâ€™s new digital fashion show application.

<i>HINT: There were only two teams and we tied. They won best Business Strategy and we won best Technical Implementation.</i>

## Tools We Used:
<i>and tried to use</i>
- Java
- Spring Boot
- HTML, JS, CSS,
  - JPA, JSTL, Spring Tags, Lombok
- Docker
- MongoDB
- AWS
  
## Extra Info
This was a three and a half day event where a whole website, front-end, back-end and database was needed to be created. If you want the Cart to work, go to ```designers>yeezy``` and select:
- Two VULTURES MASK
- One VULTURES LONG BLACK T
- One VULTURES PANT BLACK
- One YZY PODS
  
Scroll to the top and the cart will now have 5 items in it. Click it and you will see all five items. Needless to say, this was hardcoded.
